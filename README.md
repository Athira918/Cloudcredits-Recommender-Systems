# Cloudcredits-Recommender-Systems
Recommender systems are widely used in various applications, such as e-commerce, streaming services, and online marketplaces, to provide personalized recommendations to users. This project focuses on building a recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques based on user ratings. The dataset used includes user ratings for different movies, which helps predict user preferences and recommend relevant content.
**Data Preprocessing:**
Loading the dataset containing user ratings and movie titles.
Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Understanding the dataset by analyzing the distribution of ratings and the most popular movies.
Visualizing user behavior and rating patterns.
**Building the Recommender System:**
Implementing collaborative filtering techniques, including:
User-based collaborative filtering
Item-based collaborative filtering
Computing similarity scores between users or items.
**Model Evaluation:**
Assessing the accuracy of the recommendations using evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or precision-recall analysis.
Comparing different recommendation techniques.
**Results:**
The implementation of the recommender system successfully provided personalized movie recommendations based on user behavior. Collaborative filtering effectively identified patterns in user preferences, allowing the system to suggest movies similar to those previously rated highly by users. The evaluation metrics indicated a reasonable level of accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
**Conclusion:**
This project highlights the importance of recommender systems in enhancing user experiences in various domains. The use of collaborative filtering proves to be a powerful technique for predicting user preferences. Future improvements could include incorporating deep learning techniques, hybrid recommendation approaches, or additional contextual information to further refine the recommendations.
